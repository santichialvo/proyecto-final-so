When a ("parent") process starts another ("child") process (via fork(2)), the environment the environment of the parent is copied to produce the environment of the child. There is no inheritance-style association between those two environments thereafter, they are completely separate. So there is no "global" or "master" environment we could change, to achieve what you want. Agregado para que entre al indirecto.
